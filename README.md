## Linear Regression to Predict MPG  

![Deleverable1](https://github.com/MarcoFernandez14/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Deliverable%201%20Linear%20Regression.png)  

* The vehicle length, and vehicle ground clearance have non-random amounts of variance and also have a significant impact on mpg.
* The p-Value is 5.35e-11, is less than the assumed significance level of 0.05%. This indicates that we should reject our null hypothesis and also that the slope of the model is not zero.
* The r-squared value is 0.7149, which means that around 71% of mpg predictions can be defined/predicted by this model.
